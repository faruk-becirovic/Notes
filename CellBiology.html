<h3 id="org09ea508"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The cell is basic unit of biology. Every organism either consists of a cells or it is a single cell itself.
Understanding the cell is necessary to be able to undrestand the organism itself. Cells are not static.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7381031" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7381031"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Cell Theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The history of Cell Biology started 300 years ago, when European scientist started using crude lenses to observe various materials, including biological materails, such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Human blood and sperm,</li>
<li>Plants,</li>
<li>Tree bark</li>
<li>Mold etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Robert Hooke was among them. He used the lense to observe a piece of cork. He observed thin walls separating the small pieces of the cork. He named those pieces cells (lat. cellula - little room).
Anthonie Van Leeuwenhoek was first to use small lenses to observe living cells.
Schwan obsreved animal and plant cells and came to conclusion that they share same fundamental structure. Based on his observations, in 1839, Schwan developed his unified cell theory, with two basic principles:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All organisms consist of one or more cells.</li>
<li>Cell is basic unit of structure for all organisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In 1855, Virchow made conclusion that all cells arose from the divison of the preexisting cells, thius adding another princilple to the Schwan's theory:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All cells arise only from preexisting cells.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thus, the cell is not only basic unit of structure of living organisms, it is also basic unit of reproduction for all living organisms.
</p>

<h3 id="org51bdcc5"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Structure of the Cell</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
At the basic level all cells have some common features. All cells have:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Chromosomes</dt><dd>cary genes,</dd>
<dt>Rybosomes</dt><dd>make proteins,</dd>
<dt>Cytosol</dt><dd>semifluid substance,</dd>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
The basic structural and functional unit of every organism is:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Procaryotic cell, or</li>
<li>Eucaryotic cell.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Bacteria and Archaea are the only types of organisms that consist of procaryotic cells. While other organisms; Protists, Fungi, animals, and plants consist of eucaryotic cells.
</p>

<p>
Eucaryotic cells are characterised by having:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DNA nucleus bounded my membranous nuclear envelope,</li>
<li>Membrane bounded organells,</li>
<li>Cytoplasm in the regioon bethween the plasma membrane and the nucleus.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Typically, eucaryotic cells are significantlly larger that procaryotic cells.
</p>

<p>
Procaryotic cells are characterised by having:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No nucleus,</li>
<li>No membrane bound organells,</li>
<li>DNA resides in the unbounded region of the cell called nucleoide,</li>
<li>Cytoplasm which is bounded by plasma membrane.</li>

<h3 id="orgad98f02"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> Scientific Method</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Science is not a collection of facts but a process of discovering answers to questions about the natural world. Answering those questions relies on the use of the scientific method,
which involves creating hypotheses, that can be tested for validity by collection of data through well-designed and controlled experiments. Science is based on consistency and reproducibillity.
As hypotheses become more accepted, they become referred to as a theory, and as theories become more accepted they become referred to as laws. However, theories and laws can be modified,
exteded or even refuted as new facts come to light.

<h3 id="orga962fff"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> The Importance of Carbon</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Carbon atom is the most important atom in biologic molecules.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org45474b1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org45474b1"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.1.</span> Carbon valence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
Carbon has valence of 4, which allows carbon to form chemical bonds with 4 other atoms. This means that carbon atom lacks 4 electrons in the outermost orbital to me at it's most stable state.
Carbon atoms tend to associate with eachother or with other electron-defficient atoms, an arangement in which the share pairs of electrons, one from each atom. Such sharing means that carbon forms
covalent bonds. Carbon is most likely to form covalent bonds with other carbon atoms or with oxygen, hidrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4aac615" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4aac615"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.2.</span> Stability of Carbon-Containing Molecules</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
The stability of organic molecules is the property of the favorable electronic configuration of each carbon atom in the molecule. This stability is expressed as bond energy - the amount of energy required to
brake 1 mol of such bonds. Bond energy is usually expressed as calories per mole (cal/mol), where a calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of  a 1 g of by 1 C and a kilo-calorie kcal is
equal to 1000 cal.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf377ca8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf377ca8"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.3.</span> Carbon-containing molecules are diverse</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-3">
<p>
Carbon-containing compounds are characterised by great diversity of molecules that can be generated with few different elements. The diversity of carbin stems from its tetravalent nature, that is,
the abillity of each carbon atom to form covalent bonds with four other atoms. Because one or more of these bonds can be formed with other carbon atoms, molecules consisting of long chains or even ring containing
carbon atoms can be formed. The molecules containing chain-linked carbon atom can have firther increase in diversity by the presence of doule bonds in the carbon-carbon chain. Furthermore these chains often
contain other elements. One such element is hydrogen, these molecules are very common in the nature and are called hydrocarbons.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc136ba2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc136ba2"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.4.</span> Functional groups</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-4">
<p>
Hydrocarbons play a limited role in the biological systems. However, great number of compounds can be formed that, in addition to carbon and hydrogen, can contain one or more atoms of oxygen, nitrogen,
phosphorus, or sulphur. These atoms are often part of various functional Groups. Functional groups are specific arrangement of atoms that confer specific chemical properties on the molecules they are atached to.
</p>

<p>
Some of these functional groups are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Negatively charged groups:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Carboxyl</li>
<li>Phosphate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Neutral but polar groups:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hydroxyl</li>
<li>Sulfhydryl</li>
<li>Carbonyl</li>
<li>Aldehyde</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Positively charged groups:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Amino</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="org186dd98"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.5.</span> Carbon-conatining molecules can form stereoisomers</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-5">
<p>
Carbon-containing molecules can have even furher capacity for diversity. Carbon atom has a tetrahedral structure. When four different atoms, or groups of atoms, are bonded to the four corners of the structure
two different spatial configurations are possible. Despite having the same structural formula they are not superimposale, and are in fact mirror images of each other. Such structural cariations of the same
compond are known as stereoisomers. Carbon atom with four different substituents is called asymetric carbon atom because two stereoisomers are posible for each asymetric carbon atom. Compound with n
asymetric carbon atoms will have 2<sup>n</sup> possible stereoisomers.

<h3 id="orgf16d715"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> The importance of water</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The water has a biologically important role. Water acts as an universal solvent in biological systems. Water is the most abundant component in cells and organisms. Typical cell contains around 75-58% of
water by weight. It is important to understand the chemical properties of water in order to fully appriciate and understand the role it plays in the biological systems.

Unequal distribution of electrons within a water molecule give it it's polarity. Polarity can be defined as uneven distribution of charge within a molecule. In order to understant the polarity of water the
shape of the molecule needs to be considered. The two hydrogen atoms are bonded to an oxygen atom at an angle of exactly 104.5 deg. This angele causes the polarity of water. Evendough the molecule as a whole is
uncharged, the oxygen atom is highly electronegative, giving the part of the molecule with the oxygen partial negative charge, and correspondinglly the oposite side has partial electropositivity.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">
<p>
Because of its high polarity the water molecules are atracted to eachother and tend to orient themselves in a speciffic way. The electronegatively charged oxygen tends to form bonds with the positively charged
hydrogen atoms in the adjecent water molecule. They form bonds called hydrogen bonds, a type of noncovalent bond that are much weaker in comparison to the covalent bond, around one-tenth as strong.
As a result of these bonds the water molceule can associate itself with at least three adjencent water mollecules and thus form extendive three-dimensional netork of hydrogen-bonded molecules. These bonds are
being constantly broken and reformed. This tendency of water to form hydrogen bonds is what makes the water so highly cohesive. This cohesiveness accounts for the high surface tension of the water, high boiling
point, high speciffic heat and high heat of vapourisation.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-3">
<p>
The existane of hydrogen bonds between water molecules give water high temperature stabilising capacity. Due to the hydrogen bonds, water has high speciffic heat. Speciffic heat is the amount of heat a substance
needs to absorb per gram to increase its temperature 1 deg C. The speciffic heat of water is 1 cal/g. In other liquids this heat would increase the motion of the solvent molecules and therfore would lead to
increse in temperature. In water, however this energy is spent to breake the weak hydrgen bonds between the water molecules. This causes water to have signifficantly higher speciffic heat compared to other
liquids. This also cause water to have high heat of vapourisation, which is the amount of energy needed to convert 1 g of liquid into vapour. These properties give water its cooling capabillity, which is very
important sice cellular metabolic activities release high amount of heat energy and would othervise pose a serious overheating problem.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-4">
<p>
From biological perspective, one of the most important properties of water is its exellence as a general solvent. A solvent is a fluid in which other subsances, solutes, can be dissolved. Water is important
solvent because its capacity to dissolve large number of solutes. This characteristic is caused by the waters high polarity. Most molecules in cells are also polar, meaning they readily form hydrogen bonds or
ioniq bonds with water mlecules. Molecules that readily dissolve in the warter are dubbed hydrophullic, while molecules that are not very soluable in water are called hydrophobic. Most small organic molecules
are hydrophillic, such as sugars, organic accids, and some amino accids. Lipids and some proteins, such as those found in biological membranes, are hydrophobic. Some macrmolecules such as some proteins posess
both hydrophillic and hydrophobic qualities. That is certain speciffic reagions of the molecule have affinity for water while others do not. In general polar molecules and ions are hydrophillic while non polar
molecules are hydrophobic.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-1">
<p>
Proteins are linear polymers of amino accids. Evendough around 60 amino accids are typically present in the cell, only around 20 of them regularlly participate in the synthesis of proteins. Protein may contain
all or most of the 20 deifferent amino accids, their proportions may vary gratly, and no two proteins share the same amino accid sequence. Every amino accid shares the same basic structure, with a carboxyl group,
an amino group, hydrogen atom, and a side chain known as R group. All are atached to central carbon atom known as <i>alpha carbon</i>. Only exception is glycine whose R group is a single hydrogen atom. All amino accid
have an asymemtric carbon atom, meaning they exist in two stereoisomeric states, called <i>L-</i> and <i>-D</i> amino accids. Both kinds exist in nature but only L-amino accids occur in proteins. Since all amino accids
have carboxyl and amino group, their different properties come from the variance of the R group, which can range from a single hydrogen atom to relatively complex aromatic groups. Nine of the 20 amion accids have
nonpolar, hydrophobic R groups. The remaining 11 amino accids have a hydrophillic R group, which can either be distinctly polar, or actually charged at the pH values characteristic of the cells.
</p>

<p>
The process of stringing individual amino accids together into linear polymer involves the stepwise addition of each new amino accid to the growing chain by a <i>dehydration</i> (or <i>condensation</i>) <i>reaction</i>.
As three atoms comprising H20 are removed, the carboxyl carbon of one amino accid and the nitrogen of a second are linked directly. This covalent C-N bond linking the two amino accids is known as a
<b>peptide bond</b>.  This process of elongating amino accids is often called <i>protein synthesis</i>, the term is not entirely accurate since the product of amino accid polymerisation is not protein but a <b>polypeptide</b>.
</p>

<p>
A protein is a polypeptide chain that has a unique, stablem three-dimensional shape, and is biologically active as a result. Some proteins consist of a single polypeptide and are called <b>monomeric proteins</b>.
Proteins that consist of two or more polypeptides, known as <i>polypeptide subunits</i> are called <b>multimeric proteins</b>.
</p>

<p>
Polymers are disassembled to monomers by <i>hydrolysis</i>, a reaction that is a reverse of a dehydration reaction.

Nucleic accids are molecules that are have a role of storing, transmitting, and expressing genetic information. Nucleic accids are linear polymers of nucleotides strung together in a genetically determined
order that is critical to their role as informational macromolecules. The two major types of nucleic accids are <b>DNA (deoxyribonucleic accid)</b> and <b>RNA (ribonucleic accid)</b>. DNA and RNA differ in their chemistry

The monomeric units of nucleic accids are nucleotides. DNA and RNA have four different nucleotides each. Each nucleotide consists of a five-carbon sugar which has a phosphate group attached to it and a
nitrogen-containing arromatic base. The sugar is <i>D-ribose</i> (RNA), or <i>D-deoxyribose</i> (DNA). The phosphate is joined by phosphoester bond to the 5' carbon of the sugar, while the base is attached to 1' carbon.
The base can be either <i>purine</i> or <i>pyrimidine</i>.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>aldosugars, with terminal carbonyl group,</li>
<li>ketosugars, with an internal carbonyl group,</li>

<p>
The single most common monosaccharide in the biological world has been the <i>aldohexose D-glucose</i>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Lipids differ from other macromolecules because they are not formed by the linear polymerisation. However, they are regarded macromolecules because of their high molecular weight and important role in cellular
structures. Lipids constitute a heterogeneous category of cellular components that resemble one another. Their distiguishing feature is their hydrophobic nature. Lipids are, however, soluable in nonpolar solvents
such as chlorophorm and ether. They may, also, have various different chemical characteristics and structures, and play different roles accordingly. They have three main roles in the cell:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>energy storage,</li>
<li>membrane structure,</li>
<li>speciffic bilogical functions, such as transmission of signals in the cell.</li>
</ul>

Based on their chemical structure, lipids can be divided in several classes:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>fatty accids</li>
<li>triacylglycerols,</li>
<li>phospholipids,</li>
<li>glycolipids,</li>
<li>steroids,</li>
<li>terpenes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Fatty accids consist of long hydrocarbon chains of 12-20 carbon atoms with a carboxylic accid group at one end. Thet are energy rich molecules found in triacylglycerols that make up animal fat and vegetable oils.
They are also found in the phospholipids found in cellular membranes.
</p>

<p>
Phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids are types of phospholipids that make up the lipid layer of biological membranes.  They are amphipatic molecules with two hydrophobic fatty accid chains and a polar
phosphate-containing head group.
</p>

<p>
Glycolipids are similar to phospholipids but they contain a polar carbohydrate group instead of phosphate. They are found on the outer surface of the membranes, where they play a role in cell reckognition.

Other important cellular lipids are steroids, which include cholesterol and several sex hormones, and the terpenes, which include vitamin A and some important coenzymes.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Based on the structureal differences of their cells organisms have been divided into two broad groups:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Eucaryotes</dt><dd>plants, animals, fungi, alagae, and protozoa; these cells have a true membrane-bounded nucleus,</dd>
<dt>Prokaryotes</dt><dd>bacteria, and archaea; these cells don't have true membrane-bounded nucleus, suggesting evolutionarilly earlier form of life.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This way of classification of cells has attracted some crithisism, because it implies that cells that lack some feature share same atributes and thus they are related, which is, in many cases, not true.
Additionally, cells that do share a common attribute may only be disstantly related. Another way of classifying organisms is by sorting them in one of three domains: bacteria, archaea, and eucarya.
</p>

<p>
Cells come in various shapes and sizes, some of the smallest bacterial cells are about 0.2-0.3 microns in diameter, on the other hand there are elongated nerve cells which may extend to several meters in size.
Another example of the large cell is a birds egg, which is an extremely large single cell. However, these examples are outliers, and most cells fall in more predictable size ranges. Eucaryotic cells are usually
somwhere between 1-5 microns, while most animal and higher plant cells are in the range of 10-100 microns.
</p>

<p>
Cells size is determined by several factors:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Surface area / volume ratio</dt><dd>Cells volume determines the amount of nutrients able to be stored in the cell, and also the amount of material excreted out of the cell. On the other hand
surface area determines the amount of available surface the cell has to interact with extracellular space, that is the availability of the membranes necessary to handle flow of meterial in and out of the cell.</dd>
<dt>Diffusion rates of molecules</dt><dd>Cells are limited  by how rapidly can molecules move around the cell. Cells, primarrily move by the means of diffusion. Diffusion is free, unassisted movement of a substance from
a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.</dd>
<dt>Need to maintain adequate concentration of reactants and catalysts</dt><dd>For a chemical reaction to occur in the cell, the appropriate reactants must collide with and bind to a particular enzyme. The rate of
collision will be gratlly improved with the increase in substance's concetration within the cell.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
An effective proble to the concentration problem is the <i>compartmentalisation of activities</i> within a speciffic region of the cell. High concentration of a substances is neede only in those particular region,
rather than, throughout the cell. To compartmentalise activities, most euaryotic cells have a variety of organelles, wich are membrane bounded compartments inside the cell, specialised for a speciffic functions.

Rybosome is not a real organelle since it is not bounded by a membrane. However, they do play an importan role in the cell and they do have a specialised function within the cell. They are found in all cells, but
they differ from size and number, depending on the cell type. They play an important role in protein sythesis. They are made of protein and RNA.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Energy is the capacity to do work. Another definition of energy is that enery is the capacity to cause speciffic physical or chemical changes. There are six cathegories of change within cell, and six kinds of
work that require an output of energy:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Synthetic work</dt><dd>Important work within every cell is work of <b>biosythesis</b>. This work results in the formation of new chemical bonds and synthesis of new molecules. Also, synthetic work is necesary to maintain
existing cellular structures.</dd>
<dt>Mechanical work</dt><dd>Cells often need for <b>mechanical work</b> which involves physical changes in the position or orientation of the cell, or structures within the cell.</dd>
<dt>Concentration work</dt><dd>The purpose of this kind of work is to either accumulate substances within a cell or organelle or to remove potentionaly toxic byproduct of cellular activity.</dd>
<dt>Electrical work</dt><dd>A specialised case of concentration work, as it requires movement acreos membranes, but in this case the movement in question includes ions and the result is not just change in concentration,
but also a change in charge difference, or <i>electric potential</i>.</dd>
<dt>Generation of heat</dt><dd>Heat is released as byproduct of many chemical reactions.</dd>
<dt>Generation of light</dt><dd>Another way cells use energy is the production of light, or <b>bioluminesence</b>. Light is produced by variety of bioluminescent organisms and is generated by the reaction of ATP with
specific luminescent compounds.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Nearly all life on Earth is sustained, either directly or indirectly, by the sunlight. Not all organisms can obtain energy from the sunlight directly. Based on their energy sources, organisms can be classified
as <b>phototrophs</b> or <b>chemotrophs</b>. Furthermore, organisms can also be classiied as <b>autotrophs</b> or <b>heterotrophs</b>. Depending on wether their source of carbon is carbon dioxide or organic molecules, respectively.
Most organism are either <i>photoautotrophs</i> or <i>chemoheterotrophs</i>.
</p>

<p>
Organism can obtain energy either from sunlught or from oxidation of chemical compounds.
</p>

<p>
The principles governing energy flow are subject of an area of science called thermodynamics. Energy distributed through the universe is constant and consistent. Energy gets transformed from one from to another.
Energy is organised in <i>systems</i>, which can be either <i>open</i> or <i>closed</i>, and the rest of the universe, outside of the system, is termed the <i>surroundings</i>. Closed system is energy system that cannot exchange
exchange energy with the system, energy cannot be added or removed from the system. Closed system is an energy system that can exchange energy with the surroundings. Organisms are open systems.

<h2 id="orgab04ea5"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Enzymes: The Catalyst of Life</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Thermodynamics alow for the assessment of the feasabillity of a reaction, it says nothing about the likelyhood that the reaction will actually occur at a reasonable rate in the cell. For a given chemical reaction
to occur in the cell, substrates must react the transition state, which has a higher free energy than either the substrates or product. Reaching transition state requires the input of activation energy. Because of
this activation energy barrier, most biologycal compounds exist in an unreactive, metastable state. To ensure that the activation energy requirement is met and the transition state is achieved, a catalyst is
required, which is always an enzyme in biologycal systems.
</p>

<p>
Catalysts, wether organic or inorganic, act by forming transient complexes with substrate molecules that lower the activation energy barrier and increase the rate of a particular reaction. Chemical reactions in
cells are catalysed by enzymes, which in some cases require organic or inorganic cofactors for activity. The vast majority of enzymes are proteins. Few enzymes are composed of RNA and are called ribozymes.
Enzymes are very soecific, either for a single specific substrate or for a class of closely realated compounds. This is because the actual catalytic process takes place at the active site, a pocket gooce on the
enzyme surface that only the correct substrate will fall into. The active site is composed of specific, noncontignous amino accids that become positioned near each other as the protein folds into its tertiery
structure. These amino accids are responsible for substrate binding, substrate activation, and catalysis. Binding the appropriate substrate at the active site causes a change in the shape of the enzyme and
substrate known as induced fit. This facilitates substrate activation, often by distorting one or more bonds in the substrate, by bringing necessary amino accid side chainsinto the active site, or by transferring
protons and possibly electrons between the enzyme and substrate.
